### Features Added\Updated

In MPLAB&reg; PowerSmart&trade; Digital Control Library Designer, release 0.9.14.676 labels of user extension function hooks changed, causing the compiler to fail when new control code is generated. This firmware release ensures compatibility with the latest version of this code generating tool.

When you download this version of the firmware, please also update your version of PowerSmart&trade; Digital Control Library Designer to version 0.9.14 or higher:

# dpsk3-power-boost-voltage-mode-control, release v1.2.0

### Release Highlights

##### Fault Handler

In this release the fault handler device driver got optimized and fault indication got improved. The improved fault handler now supports the declaration
of a maximum number of restart attempts after the power supply has been shut down during fault conditions. This setting will put the power supply into 
a safe state after 'n' unsuccessful restart attempts. If any of the restart procedures passes the POWER GOOD state and reaches state ONLINE, the restart
counter is reset. The default number has been set to 10. This setting can be changed by editing `#define BOOST_FAULT_RESTART_CYCLES` in file dpsk3_hwrdescr.h

This new feature prevents the power supply from ending up in an endless hiccup condition where the power supply is continuously driven into fault conditions 
with the potential risk of over stressing components, connected sources or loads. The 'safe state' is OFF, where the controller still acquires ADC data but 
keeps the power supply turned off and PWM outputs disabled. The on-board LED flashes at a higher frequency and the error code "(LA)" is displayed on the LCD to 
indicate the latched fault condition.

In this condition a CPU reset or power cycle is required to restart the power supply.

##### Boost Converter Control Loop

The latest release of PowerSmart Digital Control Loop Designer introduced a new/revised Anti-Windup Limiter feature allowing to clamp the PWM output to zero 
when the control output drops below a defined minimum. Ã‚ second Anti-Windup Limiter feature allows the digital loop controller to 'saturate' the control history, 
resulting in a delayed soft recovery. By enabling both features, the no-load cycle skipping of the asynchronous boost converter improved significantly and also solved 
the issue of drifting output voltage when the input voltage is close to the nominal output voltage.

### Features Added\Updated

- Boost converter control loop was revised for achieving better behaving cycle-skipping in no load conditions
- Improved cycle skipping now results in tight and drift-less output voltage in no load conditions
- Fault object management bugfix: a sloppy if-statement accidentally disabled regulation error in Online mode
- Limitation of restart-attempts after fault shut-down with latched safe-state fault condition
- On-Board LED changes blinking frequency in fault conditions
- LC display got 4th screen showing most recent firmware version
- Fault indication on LC display is now visible on all screens (except firmware version view)
- Updated online documentation

# dpsk3-power-boost-voltage-mode-control, release v1.1.0

### Release Highlights
This code example is demonstrating the implementation of a simple digital voltage mode control loop regulating the output voltage of an asynchronous boost converter.
This example is part of a series of code examples for the Digital Power Starter Kit 3 demonstrating the implementation of specific control modes and features.

### Features Added\Updated
- Boost converter device driver update reversion the execution order of output capacitor charge-up time and power-on delay for a more robust startup when powered from slow DC sources.
- Improved fault handler over current protection management: over current protection is turned off when the converter is inactive to prevent erroneous over current detections
- Updated online documentation

# dpsk3-power-boost-voltage-mode-control, release v1.0.0
### Release Highlights
This is the initial release demonstrating the basic control loop implementation of a simple digital voltage mode control loop regulating the output voltage of an asynchronous boost converter.
This example is part of a series of code examples for the Digital Power Starter Kit 3 demonstrating the implementation of specific control modes and features.

### Features Added\Updated
This code example runs automatically after power has been applied to the development board. In this initial version the on-board LED of the dsPIC33CK Digital Power Plug-In Module is toggled with a interval period of 300 ms, when the controller is running at maximum speed of 100 MIPS. After startup, PWM generator #1 is generating a 500 kHz complementary waveform at the PWM1H/PWM1L outputs. The output voltage feedback is read through ADC input #13 and processed through the digital control loop in the respective interrupt service routine. At the end of the control loop execution the result is written to the PWM duty cycle register, eventually regulating the output voltage to the nominal 3.3 V output voltage.

During operation the most recent values of input voltage, output voltage, output current and temperature are displayed on the on-board LCD. The screens can be switched by pressing the User button for more than 1 second.
